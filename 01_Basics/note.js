/*
add a folder -> add a fie under the folder -> write code -> open terminal in view -> node filename (enter)
download latest node js from nodejs.org and install it -> check it in terminal node -v
compiler interpreter sw have the syntax structure reading capability
we can inject the js files in to the engine and execute the file in javascript
node.js is a sw/execution engines which is downloaded and set up inside the editor VS and execute .js files
code editor advantage - colour editing, colour console, colour correction, intendation 
tree parser is a hirarchical node structure function used to read code and build a tree structure or code structre format
inside github -> in repo-> code -> view - command pallete -> container -> node js with javascript -> create folder -> same process of file execution
after writing code -> source control -> + -> commit -> push
codespace -> 3dot -> delete - close the engine
{} -> block scope
if no value is assigned to a variable, it is defined as undefined
for string "" required, but for int,float not required
; is optional
dont use var, use let and const is not editable
"use strict" - engine will consider all the code in new standard version of js
ECMA - standard community
datattypes in js => number - 2>53, bigint, String - "", boolean-T/F, null - standalone value, undefined, symbol - unique   
while converting a string and undefined to number -> Nan will be output
for boolean true ->1 and false -> 0 and null -> 0
node foldername/file name.js - to execute a file
if i am adding string with number , then the first one will always be preferred
+ sign is used to convert any value to number, if it cant convert Nan value will come
strict equality - ===, loose equality - ==,>,>=,<=
// == - checks only value, === - checks value and datatype
primitive datatype - immutable,call the data by value    non primitive - mutable,call the data by reference
// immutable - cannot be changed, mutable - can be changed
// immutable - string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, BigInt
// mutable - object, array, function
// object - key value pair, array - ordered list of values, function - block of code
javascript is statically typed language or dynamically typed language
// statically typed - type of variable is known at compile time, dynamically typed - type of variable is known at runtime
// javascript is a prototype based language
// prototype - a template or blueprint for creating objects
// prototype chain - a chain of objects that are linked together
// prototype inheritance - a way to create new objects based on existing objects
// prototype based language - a language that uses prototypes to create objects
// prototype based inheritance - a way to create new objects based on existing objects using prototypes
// prototype based programming - a programming paradigm that uses prototypes to create objects
// prototype based programming language - a programming language that uses prototypes to create objects
datatype of null is object
// null is a primitive value, but its type is object
// typeof non primitive value is object
// typeof primitive datatype is object / or functionObject
// typeof function is objectFunction
